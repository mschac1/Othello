# Othello
Java project written in 2005
Pretty good use of MVC architecture. Also programmed a simple AI which uses a recursive algorithm to select the best move based on the total points scored over the next turns
Currently, the AI settings are hard coded, which means the GUI user cannot set, whether or not the AI is actived or change the difficulty
This would be better done through menus
